Build an Asteroids Game

Setup:

We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids. If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) version of the game.

The finished project

Prerequisites
Python 3.10+ installed (see the bookbot project for help if you don't already have it)
Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)
Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project are:

Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!
The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you will simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you, you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.

Assignment
To get started, make sure you have the Boot.dev CLI installed and working.

Run and submit the tests using the CLI.

The tests just ensure that the CLI is installed and configured correctly.

Installation
We are going to be using pygame and a virtual environment to develop our game.

Pygame
Pygame is a module for developing games using Python. It provides simple functions and methods for us to easily draw images within a GUI window and handle user input.

Virtual Environment (venv)
Virtual environments are Python's way to keep dependencies (e.g. the pygame module) separate from other projects on our machine. For example, we need pygame version 2 for this project, but another project on your computer might require version 1.

As a best practice, each Python project on your machine should have its own virtual environment to keep them isolated from each other.

Assignment
Create a new directory and Git repository for this project somewhere on your computer.
Create a virtual environment at the top level of your project directory:
python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate

You should see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt, for example, mine is:

(venv) wagslane@MacBook-Pro-2 Asteroids %

Make sure that your virtual environment is activated when running the game or using the bootdev CLI.

Create a file called requirements.txt in the top level of your project directory with the following contents:
pygame==2.6.1

This tells Python that this project requires pygame version 2.6.1.

Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip is Python's package manager. It will install the pygame module into the virtual environment you created.

Make sure pygame is installed:
python3 -m pygame

This will result in an error (the test expects an exit code of 1), but the output will show that pygame is installed.

Run and submit the CLI tests.

If you are on WSL, you will probably need to install VcXsrv to run pygame. Follow the installation and configuration instructions on the linked site. If you need help at any point, ask in the community Discord.

Pygame
Now that we have pygame installed, let's write just a bit of boilerplate code so that we have a runnable program to build on.

Assignment
Create a new file called main.py.
On the first line, import pygame:
# this allows us to use code from
# the open-source pygame library
# throughout this file
import pygame

Write a main function that simply prints "Starting Asteroids!" (use this exact text).
Add this if statement to the end of the file:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This line ensures the main() function is only called when this file is run directly; it won't run if it's imported as a module. It's considered the "pythonic" way to structure an executable program in Python. Technically, the program will work fine by just calling main(), but you might get an angry letter from Guido van Rossum if you don't.

Run the program with python3 main.py
Run and submit using the Boot.dev CLI.

Modules
It would be a massive pain if we had to fit all of our code into a single file.

Importing
In Python, each .py file is a module, and we can import functions, variables, and classes from one module into another with the import statement. The name of a module is the filename (without the .py extension).

# import the connect_database function
# and the database_version variable
# from database.py into the current file
from database import connect_database, database_version

If you want to import everything from a module, you can use the * character:

# import everything from the module
# database.py into the current file
from database import *

However, it's generally recommended to avoid wildcard imports (*) as they make your code harder to read and debug. You can read more about this in the Python style guide.

Constants
Games often have a lot of magic numbers to represent things like player speeds, item costs, and attack damage. We will use this file as a place to store those kind of constant values.

Assignment
Create a new file in your project called constants.py (in the same folder as main.py), and paste this in:
SCREEN_WIDTH = 1280
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 720

ASTEROID_MIN_RADIUS = 20
ASTEROID_KINDS = 3
ASTEROID_SPAWN_RATE = 0.8  # seconds
ASTEROID_MAX_RADIUS = ASTEROID_MIN_RADIUS * ASTEROID_KINDS

Import everything from the constants.py file into main.py
Print out the SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT values when main.py is run. Use the following format:
Along with a greeting from importing pygame, the expected output is the following:

Starting Asteroids!
Screen width: 1280
Screen height: 720

Game Loop
Video games are generally built using a game loop. The simplest game loop has 3 steps:

Check for player inputs
Update the game world
Draw the game to the screen
To create a good user experience, these 3 steps need to happen many times per second.

Assignment
import pygame at the top of your main.py file. The pygame documentation will be super useful throughout this project.
Initialize pygame at the beginning of your main() function (take a look at the docs for the syntax).
Ensure our predefined constants (constants.py) SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT are imported at the top of your file:
from constants import *

Because this is a smaller project, and we don't risk conflicting import names, we're going to use a wildcard import for convenience. In a larger project, you'd want to import only the constants you need.

Use pygame's display.set_mode() to get a new GUI window:
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))

Create the game loop. For now, we'll only worry about step 3: drawing the game onto the screen.
Use an infinite while loop for the game loop. At each iteration, it should:
Use the screen's fill method to fill the screen with a solid "black" color.
Use pygame's display.flip() method to refresh the screen. Be sure to call this last!
It's a good idea to run and test your game frequently as you write code , to make sure it's working as expected:
If you're on a mac, wait until step 8 before doing this.
python3 main.py

You should see a black window open and stay open.

Close the game and kill the program with Ctrl+C in the terminal.
Add the following code to the beginning of each iteration of the game loop:
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        return

This will check if the user has closed the window and exit the game loop if they do. It will make the window's close button work.

Create a .gitignore file and add the following:
venv/
__pycache__/

These files can be regenerated, so they don't need to be tracked.

Make a git commit! It's a good idea to commit your progress whenever you get something new working.
With the window painting black and closing properly, you're ready to move on to the next step!

FPS
Right now, our game is re-drawing the screen as fast as it possibly can. This causes it to use a lot more CPU than it actually needs!

Delta Time
In math, the Greek letter delta (Î”) is often used to represent a change in a value. In game development, we use "delta time" to represent the amount of time that has passed since the last frame was drawn. This value is useful to decouple the game's speed from the speed it's being drawn to the screen.

If your computer speeds up, the asteroids shouldn't also speed up. Conversely, if your computer slows down, the asteroids shouldn't also slow down: they would just move less smoothly.

Assignment
FPS stands for frames per second. We're going to restrict our game to draw a maximum of 60 times per second, or 60 FPS.

After initializing pygame, but before the gameloop starts, create:
A new pygame.time.Clock object.
A dt variable set to 0.
At the end of each iteration of the game loop, call the .tick() method, and pass it 60. It will pause the game loop until 1/60th of a second has passed.
The .tick() method also returns the amount of time that has passed since the last time it was called: the delta time. Divide the return value by 1000 (to convert from milliseconds to seconds) and save it into the dt variable we created earlier. We're not using dt yet, but we will later.
Re-run the game. You should still see the same black screen, but this time it should use less of your system's resources!
If everything is still working as you'd expect, move on to the next step.

Sprites
Throughout this project, we will provide some of the code for you, like the class below. We want you to focus on specific parts and have pre-written the stuff that isn't related to the concepts we're trying to teach.

In pygame, there is a base class called Sprite, to represent visual objects.

Assignment
In our game, asteroids are visually represented as circles, and the player is a triangle. However, detecting collisions between circles and triangles is hard. To avoid this problem, we can cheat a little bit: the player will secretly be a circle.

The player is secretly a circle.The red circle won't be visible in the game; only we need to know it exists.

Let's create a CircleShape class that inherits from Sprite to represent objects in our game that are treated as circles (even if they aren't).

Create a new circleshape.py file and paste in the following code:

import pygame

# Base class for game objects
class CircleShape(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, x, y, radius):
        # we will be using this later
        if hasattr(self, "containers"):
            super().__init__(self.containers)
        else:
            super().__init__()

        self.position = pygame.Vector2(x, y)
        self.velocity = pygame.Vector2(0, 0)
        self.radius = radius

    def draw(self, screen):
        # sub-classes must override
        pass

    def update(self, dt):
        # sub-classes must override
        pass

CircleShape extends the Sprite class to also store a position, velocity, and radius.

Later you'll write subclasses of CircleShape and override the draw and update methods with the logic for that particular game object.

Run the CLI tests from the root of the project.

Draw Player
Let's draw a spaceship for the player!

Assignment
Add this line to constants.py to define the size of the player's ship:
PLAYER_RADIUS = 20

Create a new file called player.py with a Player class that inherits from CircleShape.

The Player constructor should take x and y integers as input, then:

Call the parent class's constructor, also passing in PLAYER_RADIUS
Create a field called rotation, initialized to 0
Paste this triangle method into your Player class:

# in the player class
def triangle(self):
    forward = pygame.Vector2(0, 1).rotate(self.rotation)
    right = pygame.Vector2(0, 1).rotate(self.rotation + 90) * self.radius / 1.5
    a = self.position + forward * self.radius
    b = self.position - forward * self.radius - right
    c = self.position - forward * self.radius + right
    return [a, b, c]

A player will look like a triangle, even though we'll use a circle to represent its hitbox. The math of drawing a triangle can be a bit fiddly, so we've written the method for you.

To draw the player, override the draw method of CircleShape. It should take the screen object as a parameter, and call pygame.draw.polygon. It takes:
The screen object
A color (use "white")
A list of points (use self.triangle() that we provided for you)
A line width (use 2)
In your main function, instantiate a Player object. You can pass these values to the constructor to spawn it in the middle of the screen:
x = SCREEN_WIDTH / 2
y = SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2
Lastly, we need to re-render the player on the screen each frame, meaning inside our game loop. Use the player.draw(screen) method we just added to do so.
Run the game. If everything worked, you should see a black screen with a white triangle in the middle. Progress!

Tip
Draw the player after filling the screen with black, but before flipping the screen.

Moving Around
We want the spaceship to be able to move; but what does that mean specifically? Let's break it down:

If we press the move-left key, the ship should rotate to the left.
If we press the move-right key, the ship should rotate to the right.
If we press the move-forward key, the ship should move forward.
If we press the move-backward key, the ship should move backward.
Left and right seem pretty similar. Let's try to write a small function to tackle those first!

Assignment
Create a new constant in constants.py to represent the player's turn speed. I named mine PLAYER_TURN_SPEED, and gave it a value of 300.
Add a new method to the Player class called rotate. It's going to take one argument: dt (I told you we'd use it!). When it's called, it should add PLAYER_TURN_SPEED * dt to the player's current rotation.
Paste in the following update method to the Player class:
    def update(self, dt):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

        if keys[pygame.K_a]:
            # ?
        if keys[pygame.K_d]:
            # ?

If you're using a non-QWERTY keyboard, you may want to change the keybindings in the code to something other than the W, A, S and D keys.

Update the missing lines to call the rotate method with the dt argument. To go left instead of right when a is pressed, you'll need to reverse dt... how can you do that...?
Hook the update method into the game loop by calling it on the player object each frame before rendering.
Run the game and make sure the a and d keys rotate the player left and right respectively.

Moving
Now instead of rotating, we need the ship to move back and forth with the W and S keys.

Assignment
Create a new constant in constants.py to represent the player speed. I named mine PLAYER_SPEED, and gave it a value of 200.
Add a new method to the Player class called .move(). It takes one argument: dt. We want to modify the player's position; but first, we need to do a little bit of math.
We start with a unit vector pointing straight up from (0, 0) to (0, 1).
We rotate that vector by the player's rotation, so it's pointing in the direction the player is facing.
We multiply by PLAYER_SPEED * dt. A larger vector means faster movement.
Add the vector to our position to move the player.
Vector Math

This is a course on programming, not vector math, so we've done the math for you. All those words boil down to these two lines of code:

forward = pygame.Vector2(0, 1).rotate(self.rotation)
self.position += forward * PLAYER_SPEED * dt

Modify the update method in the Player class to call the move method when the W or S keys are pressed.
Run the game. You should now be able to fly around the screen with the W, A, S, and D keys!

Groups
Currently, we manually call .update() and .draw() on the player object, which means our game loop is going to get more and more cluttered as we add additional objects to the game. Fortunately, pygame has a solution!

The Group class is a container that holds and manages multiple game objects. We can organize our objects into various groups to track them more easily.

You can think of them as a sort of Venn diagram. An object can be in multiple groups at the same time! Eventually, our game's groups will look something like this:

Venn-diagram of the groups we will eventually have

Creating and Using Groups
You can create a new empty group like this:

my_group = pygame.sprite.Group()

To add all instances of a Player to two groups, group_a and group_b in this example, we add a class variable (or static field) called containers to the class just like so (with literally this one line, you don't need to bother with adding this field to the class declaration):

Player.containers = (group_a, group_b)

After changing a static field like containers, make sure to create all Player objects after the change. This way, they will be correctly added to the groups.

You can iterate over objects in a group just like any other collection in Python:

for thing in group:
    thing.do_something(some_value)

You may also call the .update() method for every member of a group by calling it on the group itself:

group.update(dt)

Assignment
Before the game loop starts:

Create two groups in main.py:
updatable - all the objects that can be updated
drawable - all the objects that can be drawn
Set both groups as containers for the Player.
Change the game loop to use the new groups instead of the Player object directly.
Call the .update() method on the "updatables" group.
Loop over all "drawables" and .draw() them individually.
Run the game. It should look and behave the same as before, but now we're using groups to manage our objects.

******** NOTE *********
ok, could you explain a bit more about why setting the class variable is set in the main.py file with the single line rather than in the class with having the groups passed in?

Boots
That's a fantastic question!

The approach of setting the class variable containers directly in main.py rather than within the Player class definition follows a particular design philosophy in pygame's sprite system:

Separation of concerns: By setting the containers in main.py, the Player class itself doesn't need to know which specific groups it belongs to. This keeps the Player class focused on player behavior, not group management.

Flexibility across different scenarios: The same Player class can be used in different contexts (like menus, different levels, testing) where it might need to belong to different groups. By setting the containers outside the class, you don't hard-code this relationship.

Runtime configuration: You might want to change which groups a sprite belongs to during the game. Setting the containers externally makes this easier to manage.

Pygame's design pattern: This is specifically how pygame's Sprite system was designed to work. The Sprite class constructor automatically adds itself to all groups in its class's containers attribute when instantiated.

Think of it like this: The Player class defines what a player is and how it behaves. The code in main.py decides where that player exists in the organizational structure of your game.

This pattern is somewhat unusual compared to standard OOP practices, but it's an effective way to handle the complex relationships between game objects in pygame's sprite system.

*************************

Asteroids
It's arguable that a critical part of Asteroids is the... well, asteroids. Let's create another class to represent an asteroid.

Assignment
Create a new class called Asteroid in a new file called asteroid.py. The class should inherit from CircleShape
Add a constructor with this signature:
def __init__(self, x, y, radius):

Override the draw() method to draw the asteroid as a pygame.draw.circle. Use its position, radius, and a width of 2
Override the update() method so that it moves in a straight line at constant speed. On each frame, it should add (self.velocity * dt) to its position (get self.velocity from its parent class, CircleShape).
In the initialization code in main (before the game loop starts), create a new pygame.sprite.Group which will contain all of the asteroids.
Like we did with the Player class, set the static containers field of the Asteroid class to the new asteroids group, as well as the updatable and drawable groups.
Asteroid.containers = (asteroids, updatable, drawable)

This ensures that every instance of the Asteroid class is automatically added to these groups upon creation.

We've written an AsteroidField class for you: it contains logic for spawning new asteroids. Create a new file called asteroidfield.py, and import it in your main.py file. Paste in this code:
import pygame
import random
from asteroid import Asteroid
from constants import *


class AsteroidField(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    edges = [
        [
            pygame.Vector2(1, 0),
            lambda y: pygame.Vector2(-ASTEROID_MAX_RADIUS, y * SCREEN_HEIGHT),
        ],
        [
            pygame.Vector2(-1, 0),
            lambda y: pygame.Vector2(
                SCREEN_WIDTH + ASTEROID_MAX_RADIUS, y * SCREEN_HEIGHT
            ),
        ],
        [
            pygame.Vector2(0, 1),
            lambda x: pygame.Vector2(x * SCREEN_WIDTH, -ASTEROID_MAX_RADIUS),
        ],
        [
            pygame.Vector2(0, -1),
            lambda x: pygame.Vector2(
                x * SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT + ASTEROID_MAX_RADIUS
            ),
        ],
    ]

    def __init__(self):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self, self.containers)
        self.spawn_timer = 0.0

    def spawn(self, radius, position, velocity):
        asteroid = Asteroid(position.x, position.y, radius)
        asteroid.velocity = velocity

    def update(self, dt):
        self.spawn_timer += dt
        if self.spawn_timer > ASTEROID_SPAWN_RATE:
            self.spawn_timer = 0

            # spawn a new asteroid at a random edge
            edge = random.choice(self.edges)
            speed = random.randint(40, 100)
            velocity = edge[0] * speed
            velocity = velocity.rotate(random.randint(-30, 30))
            position = edge[1](random.uniform(0, 1))
            kind = random.randint(1, ASTEROID_KINDS)
            self.spawn(ASTEROID_MIN_RADIUS * kind, position, velocity)

In the main.py file, set the static containers field of the AsteroidField class to only the updatable group (it's not drawable, and it's not an asteroid itself).
Create a new AsteroidField object in the initialization code.
Run the game and make sure asteroids are spawning and moving across the screen, and that you didn't break your ship in the process.
